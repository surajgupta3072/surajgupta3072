I am a third year undergrad at IIT Kharagpur. I am a hybrid full stack developer. I love contributing to open source projects, and I am ever ready to learn more. I always strive to develop applications which add value to people's lives. I believe in the quote, "Success is not how much money you make, it is how much difference you bring in people's lives"

ðŸ”­ I keep learning new things and often read books.
ðŸ’¬ Talk with me about technology, finance and entrepreneurship.
ðŸŒ± Trying to live asynchronously.
âš¡ Looking forward for interesting collaborations.
